# Clarity Code Challenge
Welcome to the Clarity Skills Assessment Code Challenge. This repo is a Clarinet project that has a complete test suite, but with empty contracts. Your job is to complete the contracts in order to get all tests to pass.

You have two empty contracts already created for you and Clarinet already installed. The variables and constants you'll need have been created for you, you just need to write the functions.

## How to Submit
The app you are building is called Clearfund. It is a set of smart contracts that are responsible for creating a fictional crowdfunding app based on Clarity smart contracts.

There are currently two empty smart contracts:

1. clearfund.clar
2. donorpass.clar

Clearfund handles the primary functionality of the smart contract, while donorpass handles NFT functionality. You can find a more detailed summary of the desired functionality by examining the provided test files.

### Step 1
Fork this repo.

### Step 2
Write your smart contracts and get the tests to pass.

### Step 3
Complete the [Clarity Skills Assessment](https://blocksurvey.io/survey/t/18877abb-942f-42b8-8fa4-c68d7c04165b/r/o). The last question on the assessment is where you'll add the link to your GitHub repo.
